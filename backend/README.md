# Project: Around the U.S. Back End
## About the Project
**Around the U.S. - Back End** is a project to create a Node.js server with REST API endpoints to serve all the data requests of the [Around the U.S. - Frontend React Project](https://github.com/5hraddha/around-react). 

## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**
1. Node.js
2. Express Framework (for development)
3. Postman (for testing API endpoints)
4. EsLint
5. MongoDB

### ![node-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white)
- **Node** (or more formally *Node.js*) is an *open-source*, *cross-platform* runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 
- *Node. js* is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. 
- It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services.

### ![express-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=white)
- **Express** is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. 
- It provides mechanisms to:
  - Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
  - Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
  - Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
  - Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

### ![postman-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=for-the-badge&logo=Postman&logoColor=white)
- **Postman** is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. 
- This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses.

### ![eslint-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/eslint-3A33D1?style=for-the-badge&logo=eslint&logoColor=white)
- **ESLint** is an open-source Javascript linting utility used to find problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain style guidelines. 
- We are using [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

### ![mongodb-icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
- **MongoDB** is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that the customer wants with the querying and indexing that the customer needs.
- MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- The document model maps to the objects in the application code, making data easy to work with.
- MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.
- MongoDB is free to use.

## Directory Structures
The project has the following directory structure:  
| Directory 	| Purpose 	|
|---	|---	|
| `/models` 	| Contains all MongoDB schemas and models - all data layers. 	|
| `/routes` 	| Contains routing files. 	|
| `/controllers` 	| Contains all the route handler callbacks. 	|
| `/utils` 	| Contains all the helper methods for general purpose tasks. 	|

## REST API Endpoints
| HTTP Methods | REST API Endpoint      | Purpose                                |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `GET`        | `/users`               | Get JSON list of all the users         |
| `GET`        | `/users/:userId`       | Get a specific user profile with an ID |
| `POST`       | `/users`               | Create a specific user profile         |
| `PATCH`      | `/users/me`            | Update the current user profile        |
| `PATCH`      | `/users/me/avatar`     | Update the current user avatar         |
| `GET`        | `/cards`               | Get JSON list of all the cards         |
| `POST`       | `/cards`               | Create a new card                      |
| `DELETE`     | `/cards/:cardId`       | Delete a card by the given ID          |
| `PUT`        | `/cards/:cardId/likes` | Update a card by liking it             |
| `DELETE`     | `/cards/:cardId/likes` | Delete a like on the card              |

## Running the Project  
| Command 	| Purpose 	|
|---	|---	|
| `npm run start` 	| To launch the server 	|
| `npm run dev` 	| To launch the server with the hot reload feature 	|
